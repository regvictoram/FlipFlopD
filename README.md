# Laboratory, Computer Architecture 2
For projects in Architecture II. 
At the moment, we have:
- VHDL for a D-Type Flip-Flop.
- VHDL for a D-Type Flip-Flop with synchronous Set-Resets.
- VHDL for Flip-Flop with Daylight sensor (Lab 3, Homework). Includes Log (Bitácora).
- VHDL for FSM 2-bit Counter, done in the lab.
- VHDL for FSM Stoplight, done in the lab.
- VHDL for ALU with 4 operations (ADD, INC, AND, XOR).
